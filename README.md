# TBChestTracker - Total Battle Chest Tracker

## Description
Easily count clan chests with a hotkey and let the automation take control. 
## Features
- Manage Multiple Clans.
- Choose multiple languages for the OCR to understand.
- Track Clan Statistics and Performance
- If clanmate isn't added to Clanmate Database, OCR will detect the clanmate and add it for you while automating chest count.
- Add clanmate by using selection rectangle.
- Clan Chest Filtering. Filter only the ones you want to be added to the chest quota.
- More to be added in the future. 
## How to install
- Head over to [Releases section](https://github.com/SICGames/TBChestTracker/releases) and download the latest version TBChestTracker-Setup.exe.

## Want to contribute? 
Send message to be allowed to push updates to the project. I rather have people contribute than clone and compile solely for themselves.

## Launched Program and now what?
- In the Start Up Page, click on New Clan and create your clan. 
- Follow the OCR Wizard. 
- Begin adding new clan mates. 
- If you're using chest points, add chest point values via Clan Chest Requirements window under the Chest Points tab.
- When you're ready to begin the automation process, press F9 to start automation procecss and F10 to stop automation process.
- Everything is saved when creating new clan and when new clanmate is added, in addition when automation is stopped.
- When chest period is done, click on File then click on Export and click on the File textbox. Save it as text file or CSV file. CSV file is used to upload to Google Sheets. 
- In addition of exporting final chest count, have export options set to Delete since it will delete the clanchests.db file and allow the program to begin fresh.
